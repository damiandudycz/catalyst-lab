# Notes for building musl-llvm-clang-lto stages related to catalyst:

1. Basic changes needed for lto:
common_flags="${common_flags} -flto=thin -Werror=odr -Werror=strict-aliasing"
use="${use} lto"

2. Additional profiles:
There are currently no desktop profiles for musl/llvm.
Additional profiles were added in local overlay and are used in desktop stages.

3. nolto environment:
These packages require using nolto env changes:
 - dev-libs/mpfr

4. Rust:
To build rust, you need to have working rust or rust-bin.
This means, that without rust-bin, catalyst is not able to build rust.
By default rust-bin is masked in musl builds, due to stability concerns.
Yet there seems to be amd64 rust-bin available to download and install in current packages.
For this reason rust-bin package was unmasked for the stages.
This should work correctly, but consider this as testing feature for now.
If there are issues, they will probably not be with rust-bin package itself, but rather with rust
codebase packages build later.
Additional stage4-desktop-openrc build is used, to install base tools and rust (using rust-bin as dependency)
and later rust-bin us removed using stage4/unmerge.
Also, the rust-bin unmask entry is left in portage outside of releng directory, so that this change
will remain in generaged stage tarball.

5. releng curl fixes change:
Releng contains a fix for curl, to avoid circular dependency. This fix will probably soon not be
needed due to recent changes to this package.
These changes were overwriten in portage/package.use/releng/circular, to block this fix from being
used.
After releng removes these changes, this overwrites can be deleted from stages templates.

6. libunwind issue:
In llvm profile, there can occur an emerge block issue between sys-libs/llvm-libunwind and
sys-libs/libunwind.
In llvm profile we should use sys-libs/llvm-libunwind, but some ebuilds are not updated yet to use it,
creating a block issue.
To fix this, remporarly changes to ebuilds were manually applied to some packages.
catalyst snapshot was then manually created and used.
This is a pain in the ass issue, and should probably be fixed by updating these packages globally.

7. undefinied-version environment:
Undefinied-version env variables define these linker flags:
LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS} -Wl,--undefined-version"
These packages require using undefinied-version env changes:
 - sys-apps/keyutils
 - sys-libs/talloc
 - sys-libs/tdb
 - dev-libs/totem-pl-parser
 - dev-libs/libdex
 - sys-libs/tevent
 - sys-libs/ldb
 - dev-libs/libdex
...

8. libdex:
sys-libs/libdex package needed to be keyword unmasked, because a musl fix was currently only added to version that is keyworded.
