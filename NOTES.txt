# Bootstrapping seage1 with crossdev:
# (WIP)

1. crossdev -t powerpc64-unknown-linux-musl --show-fail-log
2. ARCH=ppc64 PORTAGE_CONFIGROOT=/usr/powerpc64-unknown-linux-musl eselect profile set default/linux/ppc64/23.0/split-usr/musl
3. powerpc64-unknown-linux-musl-emerge =gcc-13* # Version 13 is specified, as 14 fails to compile. GCC is used temporarly to build llvm/clang later. It needs to be rebuild to contain OpenMP
4. powerpc64-unknown-linux-musl-emerge llvm



# BINHOST/BINREPO

binhost - remote address of binhost to add to final stage (/etc/portage/binrepos/gentoo-binrepo). Requires also setting binhost_path in spec file.
binrepo - local or remote address. This will be used to create pkgcache_path property.
binrepo_path - added to binhost for /etc/portage/binrepos/gentoo-binrepo. Also used with binrepo to determine final pkgcache_path.
pkgcache_path - location of directory used during stage building process. This should be build with subpatch included.
binhosts_path - config property of catalyst-lab - base directory where both local and remote binrepos will be stored.
PKGCACHE_BASE_PATH - Property replaced in spec files. Could be changed to full patch maybe? Or not, depends on what works better. Probably it should stay tough.
