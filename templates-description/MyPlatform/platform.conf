# platform.conf defines the architecture for all stages and some optional shared variables.
# Within the platform directory, you should create subdirectories for each release. Every subdirectory is automatically recognized as a release definition.
# A release should group stages that share the same base profile (e.g., 23.0) and basic system configurations, such as the standard C library.
# Releases can be named as preferred by the user, but the following are suggested examples: 23.0-default, 23.0-musl, 23.0-musl-llvm-clang.

### Required Variables

# arch. Specifies the architecture. This field is mandatory and must align with values available in the Catalyst
# TOML files located in /usr/share/catalyst/arch/.
# The format for this field is <BASE_ARCH>.<SUB_ARCH>. If the sub-architecture is identical to the base architecture,
# the sub-architecture can be omitted.
# Examples:
# arch=amd64
# arch=amd64.x86_64
# arch=amd64.amd64
# arch=ppc64.cell

arch=amd64

### Optional Variables

# chost. Defines the CHOST value used by Catalyst and binhost builders.
# If not specified, it will be derived from the Catalyst TOML files for the corresponding architecture.
# In most cases, adjusting this value is unnecessary unless preparing releases for musl, in which case it is better
# to configure this in release.conf. This value is also utilized in the generated make.conf file.
# Examples:
# chost="amd64-unknown-linux-gnu"
# chost="amd64-unknown-linux-musl"

# common_flags. Sets the common compilation flags for Catalyst and binhost builders.
# If not set, it will be determined from the corresponding Catalyst TOML files.
# This value can also be customized in release.conf or stage.conf, although it is typically more appropriate
# to configure it in release.conf where core system tools are defined.
# Examples:
# common_flags="-O2 -pipe -mcpu=cell -mtune=cell -mabi=altivec -mno-string -mno-update -mno-multiple"

# cpu_flags. While not mandatory, it is strongly recommended to define this value. As the platform typically 
# represents a device or set of devices with identical CPUs, setting this value ensures that all stages 
# utilize these flags during package compilation. The value should be derived from the real device using the 
# cpuid2cpuflags command. Do not obtain this value from a QEMU environment, as it will not match the actual device. 
# If specified, a file named 00cpu-flags will be automatically created in /etc/portage/package.use.
# Examples:
# cpu_flags="CPU_FLAGS_ARM: edsp neon thumb vfp vfpv3 vfpv4 vfp-d32 aes sha1 sha2 crc32 asimddp v4 v5 v6 v7 v8 thumb2"

# use. Defines additional USE flags applied to stages that support them (e.g., stage4, livecd-stage1, livecd-stage2, binhost).
# For Catalyst stage targets, this value is added to make.conf, excluding entries from the TOML file (Catalyst applies those automatically).
# For binhost targets, this value is combined with USE flags from the TOML file and applied to make.conf.

# repos. Specifies additional Portage overlay repositories for all builds on this platform.
# Use this if you need to install software not available in the default Gentoo repository.
# Multiple values can be provided, separated by spaces. The values can specify a local path or a Git repository.
# Examples:
# repos="/var/db/repos/my_overlay"
# repos="https://github.com/damiandudycz/ps3-gentoo-overlay"
# repos="/var/db/repos/my_overlay https://github.com/damiandudycz/ps3-gentoo-overlay"

# binrepo. Specifies the binrepo used for generating stages. Binrepos expedite stage creation by caching built packages.
# Catalyst-Lab also uses this repository to store binary packages generated during the build process.
# This can be set to a local path, a Git repository, or an rsync location. For remote sources (Git, rsync), specify the type using [<TYPE>].
# If the source type is not specified, Git is assumed by default. For rsync, omit the username in this settingâ€”it should be defined in 
# /etc/catalyst-lab/catalyst-lab.conf.
# If not specified, the binrepo defaults to /var/cache/catalyst-lab/binrepos/local.
# Examples:
# binrepo="/var/cache/catalyst-lab/binrepos/local"
# binrepo="git@github.com:damiandudycz/ps3-gentoo-releases" # Requires private key access.
# binrepo="https://github.com/damiandudycz/ps3-gentoo-releases"
# binrepo="[git]https://github.com/damiandudycz/ps3-gentoo-releases"
# binrepo="[rsync]192.168.0.10:damiandudycz/ps3-gentoo-releases" # For rsync, ensure the username is set in /etc/catalyst-lab/catalyst-lab.conf.

# binrepo_path. Adds an additional path to the binrepo location, creating the final binrepo path.
# If not specified, the default path is @PLATFORM@/@RELEASE@, meaning that all stages within a single release 
# share the same binrepo. If the binhost value is set in catalyst.conf, it will be combined with this value 
# to configure the default binhost address in /etc/portage/binrepos.conf/gentoobinhost.conf.
# Examples:
# binrepo_path="@PLATFORM@/@RELEASE@"
# binrepo_path="@FAMILY_ARCH@/@PLATFORM@/@RELEASE@"
# binrepo_path="ppc/cell/23.0-default" # Using constant values instead of placeholders is not recommended.

# compression_mode. Specifies the compression mode for builds created by Catalyst.
# If not set, pixz is used by default.
# Examples:
# compression_mode="pixz"

### Optional files

# catalyst.conf. This file can be added here if you prefer to use a customized catalyst.conf for all releases and stages associated with this platform.
# In this file, you can use specific templates that will be populated with values from /etc/catalyst-lab/catalyst-lab.conf. These templates include:
# @JOBS@, @LOAD_AVERAGE@, @TMPFS_SIZE@.
# A customized catalyst.conf is also a good place to define the binhost value, which can be included in builds within the /etc/portage/binrepos.conf/gentoobinhost.conf file.
# Example of a customized catalyst.conf file:
# digests = ["blake2b", "sha512"]
# envscript = "/etc/catalyst/catalystrc"
# options = [
#         "autoresume",
#         "bindist",
#         "kerncache",
#         "pkgcache",
#         "seedcache",
# ]
# jobs = @JOBS@
# load-average = @LOAD_AVERAGE@
# var_tmpfs_portage = @TMPFS_SIZE@
# binhost = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damiandudycz/ps3-gentoo-releases/main/ppc/binpackages/"
